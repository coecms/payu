v0.8.1:
    - Environment variable corruption of bash functions by PBS is now only
      applied if the `BASH_FUNC_module()` variable is present.  This prevents
      failing under tcsh.
    - Numerical job names should now work correctly
    - Bash-like environment variable substitution can now be used in MPI flags.
      This feature may be extended to other components if necessary.
    - Multiple runs per PBS submission now supported (`runspersub`)
    - Safer import of f90nml
    - ACCESS-OM2:
        - Necessary configuration files are now copied to the restart
          directory.
        - CICE namelists now search in the prior output path if absent from the
          prior restart path
        - Safer CICE restart cleanup
    - FMS:
        - Collation by mppnccombine will now report a nonzero error code if any
          of its pool threads fails, which will halt resubmission.

v0.8:
    - Remote synchronization of run experiment with github repository
    - Error logs are now captured and archived separately from successful runs
    - PBS and error logs are now saved in the archive directory
    - Basic OpenMP support
    - FMS collation default flag update (netCDF4)

    - repeat runs (repeat: True) now delete any restart files
    - Profiler driver class introduced (not yet adopted for all)
    - Documentation update (incomplete)

v0.4.1:
